# Python - Data-Visualization
In this project, I explored the Sephora skincare set. I used the Python's Panda library for data cleansing and preparation. I used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data.

  * Plot 1: Product count and median price per category.
  * Plot 2: Correlation matrix among several data points.
  * Plot 3: Scatter plot between price and review score.

Key takeaways:
  * Moisturizer is the most common product (hihgest product count). Neck cream is the most expensive product (highest median price).
  * People who added a product to the love list would also tend to leave a review if they purchased it (moderate positive correlation between n_of_loves and n_of_reviews).
  * No observable relationship between price and review score.
